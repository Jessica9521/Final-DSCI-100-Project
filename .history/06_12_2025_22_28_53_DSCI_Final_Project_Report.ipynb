    "Background Recruiting and retaining active users is critical for running online gaming experiments. The UBC Minecraft research server, led by Prof. Frank Wood, offers an open-access environment in which every movement and click are automatically logged. While the server generates rich behavioural data, only a small fraction of players eventually subscribe to the project’s game-related newsletter—a low-cost channel for announcing new experiments, updates, and funding opportunities. Being able to predict subscription likelihood from readily available player attributes would allow the team to focus recruitment messages on users most likely to engage, thereby increasing subscription rates without expanding marketing effort.\n",

    "A total of 196 players were recorded in this study on the UBC Minecraft research server led by Prof. Frank Wood in an open-access environment where player interactions are automatically logged. This study was conducted for a bit more than 2 months, from 2024-08-01 to 2024-11-30. Of the players who did subscribe to a game related newsletter, we found that subscription rates differed by experience, age, and played hours. In terms of experience level, players who were veterans at the game were found to have the lowest subscription rate (68%) and regular players were found to have the highest subscription rate (81%), all other experience levels subscribed near similar levels (70-77%). The median age of subscribed players was below 20, whereas the median age of unsubscribed players was above 20. The logged median played hours of subscribed players was higher than the logged median played hours for unsubscribed players, the latter also has a smaller spread of datapoints.\n",

    "When using the KNN-model to classify data under these 3 variables, the accurage, precision, and recall were all near 90% showing that these 3 factors are good predictors for subsription status. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the study were expected. Younger ages, regular experience levels, and higher played hours were linked to higher subscription rates. This could be because younger players have a tendence to spend more time in the game. Regular experience levels indicate that a player has played the game more than a beginner, but lacks the experience and knowledge of a pro or veteran that has already spent a lot of time on the game, so subsribing to a game-related newsletter would seem more attractive to players seeking to learn more or progress in the game. Younger players could be more interested in subscribing to a game related newsletter because they have more time than older players. Players with higher played hours could be more interested in subscribing to a game-related newsletter because they spend more time and are more attached to the game. To accomplish the goal of figuring out the influences that impact subscription rate to the game-related newsletter to target players to subscribe, more studies must be conducted to understand why player's age, experience level, and played hours impacts their subscription rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations in this dataset are that most players in the study spent less than hour on Minecraft over the course of the study. There were also many outliers in the dataset. Having players with a wider range of playtime, or having a larger dataset, would provide better understanding to player subscription behaviour.\n"
