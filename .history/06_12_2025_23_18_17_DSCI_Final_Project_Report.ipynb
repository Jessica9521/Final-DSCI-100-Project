    "Recruiting and retaining active users is critical for running online gaming experiments. The UBC Minecraft research server, led by Prof. Frank Wood, logs all player activity in detail. However, only a small fraction of players subscribe to the game-related newsletter. Because the newsletter is used to announce experiments, updates, and funding opportunities, understanding what influences subscription behavior can help the team target their messages in a more effective way.\n",

We used these variables because we hypothesize that they play time, age, and experience level should be directly related to a player's interest in Minecraft. We hypothesize that high playing time, younger ages, and higher experience levels in a game should be linked to higher involvement in a game's community, all of which takes dedication."

    "I used the KNN-model for this part of the project because I am working with three varibles. The KNN-model uses the labels of a number of specified nearest neighbours to classify a point. The KNN-model makes no assumptions on data distribution, which helps in this case because there are some extreme outliers in the dataset as well as possible skewedness when looking at the distribution of the three predictor variables. The KNN-model assumes that nearby neighbours should have similar, or the same, label. Considerng the goal of this data analysis is to see whether or not age, experience level, and played_hours are good predctors of subscription status, testing the accuracy of a KNN model that assumes there is a correlation between each of these variables and subscription status will accomplish that goal.\n",

    "A total of 196 players were recorded in this study on the UBC Minecraft research server led by Prof. Frank Wood in an open-access environment where player interactions are automatically logged. This study was conducted for a bit more than 2 months, from 2024-08-01 to 2024-11-30. Of the players who did subscribe to a game related newsletter, we found that subscription rates differed by experience, age, and played hours. In terms of experience level, players who were veterans at the game were found to have the lowest subscription rate (68%) and regular players were found to have the highest subscription rate (81%), all other experience levels subscribed near similar levels (70-77%). The median age of subscribed players was below 20, whereas the median age of unsubscribed players was above 20. The logged median played hours of subscribed players was higher than the logged median played hours for unsubscribed players, the latter also has a smaller spread of datapoints.\n",

    "When using the KNN-model to classify data under these 3 variables, the accurage, precision, and recall were all near 90% showing that these 3 factors are good predictors for subsription status. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the study were expected. Younger ages, regular experience levels, and higher played hours were linked to higher subscription rates. This could be because younger players have a tendence to spend more time in the game. Regular experience levels indicate that a player has played the game more than a beginner, but lacks the experience and knowledge of a pro or veteran that has already spent a lot of time on the game, so subsribing to a game-related newsletter would seem more attractive to players seeking to learn more or progress in the game. Younger players could be more interested in subscribing to a game related newsletter because they have more time than older players. Players with higher played hours could be more interested in subscribing to a game-related newsletter because they spend more time and are more attached to the game. To accomplish the goal of figuring out the influences that impact subscription rate to the game-related newsletter to target players to subscribe, more studies must be conducted to understand why player's age, experience level, and played hours impacts their subscription rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations in this dataset are that most players in the study spent less than hour on Minecraft over the course of the study. There were also many outliers in the dataset. Having players with a wider range of playtime, or having a larger dataset, would provide better understanding to player subscription behaviour.\n"
