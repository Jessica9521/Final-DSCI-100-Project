    "Background Recruiting and retaining active users is critical for running online gaming experiments. The UBC Minecraft research server, led by Prof. Frank Wood, offers an open-access environment in which every movement and click are automatically logged. While the server generates rich behavioural data, only a small fraction of players eventually subscribe to the project’s game-related newsletter—a low-cost channel for announcing new experiments, updates, and funding opportunities. Being able to predict subscription likelihood from readily available player attributes would allow the team to focus recruitment messages on users most likely to engage, thereby increasing subscription rates without expanding marketing effort.\n",
